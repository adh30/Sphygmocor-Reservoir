batch_res_v14 runs a matlab script that calculates reservoir and excess pressure according to the methods described in Davies et al.[1] for SphygmocorÂ© derived files. This script has now been replaced by bRes_sp.m [batch reservoir for sphygmocor] which has been renamed to recognise that I have now written scripts to use other file sources (e.g. BPplus). This script is retained here for historical reference.
